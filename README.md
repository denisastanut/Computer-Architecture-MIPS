# Computer Architecture MIPS

This repository contains two projects developed as part of the Computer Architecture course, focusing on **MIPS processor implementations**:

- **MIPS Single-Cycle Processor**: Executes each instruction in a single clock cycle, implementing the full instruction set with a complete data path.  
- **MIPS Pipelined Processor**: Improves performance by executing instructions concurrently across a 5-stage pipeline with hazard detection.
